# GenAI-AgenticAI-Project

## Overview
The GenAI-AgenticAI-Project is a comprehensive framework designed to facilitate the development and deployment of intelligent agents using Generative AI techniques. This project leverages the power of language models to create agents capable of performing complex tasks, making decisions, and interacting with users in a natural and efficient manner.

## Features
- **Language Model Integration**: Supports multiple LLM providers including OpenAI, Hugging Face, and local models like Llama and Mistral.
- **Flexible Workflow Automation**: Offers various chain types such as sequential and parallel chains.
- **Memory Components**: Built-in memory components for maintaining context over extended interactions.
- **Function Calling and API Interaction**: Ideal for building AI-powered applications requiring external data fetching.
- **Template-Based Prompt Handling**: Simplifies experimentation with different LLM configurations.
- **Vector Database Integration**: Supports tools like Pinecone, ChromaDB, and FAISS for fast and scalable search capabilities.
